This piece of code is all by me! For the first time I didn't follow a tutorial and coded this from scratch. 
This is actually for a website my buddies and I are designing. 
We plan on adding some code to connect the site to a SQL server. 
Collecting data for service businsees sich as Barbers, Nail Techs, and so on. 
Taking this data to show your best customers, their average spedning habits, appoints booked, and much more. 
It's going to be a long ropad I can tell but I've learned a lot already. 

I've began to learn Css more and really begin using it to design a website. There is still a lot to learn though, and I plan on obtaining the knowledge. 

I even hope to use my Login Form code that I posted in the past.  

Appreciate you for checking it out!
